3. Multi-Party Involvement: The bot supports negotiation between multiple parties, ensuring that each party's interests are adequately represented.

5. Fairness & Transparency: The bot is designed to ensure fairness, avoiding biases, and providing transparent justifications for every decision or offer made during the negotiation process.
6. Multilingual Capabilities: It can negotiate in multiple languages, making it accessible in international or cross-border negotiations.

Use cases include e-commerce transactions, business contract negotiations, salary discussions, legal settlements, and even diplomatic discussions. The goal is to streamline the negotiation process, reduce time, and increase the likelihood of a win-win outcome.
